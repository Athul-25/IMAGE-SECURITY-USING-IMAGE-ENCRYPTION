This project proposes a secure (2, 2) XOR-based Visual Cryptography (VC) scheme to protect secret image transmission.
The secret image is divided into shares, which are then encrypted using the AES algorithm, creating "encapsulated shares." 
These shares ensure the image cannot be retrieved or tampered with via human visual perception. The proposed scheme improves
security by preventing fraudulent shares and ensuring the confidentiality of the transmitted image. Experimental results show
that this method offers fast execution and a minimized PSNR value while maintaining high security.
